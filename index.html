Unlike other countries, Australia has yet to deal with a disruptive online retailer presence from companies such as Amazon. But rumors of Amazon’s imminent entrance into the Australian retail sector are ramping up, so it’s safe to assume that we’re looking at one of the last few years of brick-and-mortar retailers enjoying this level of market dominance.</p></blockquote></div>

Having spent the last four years spreading my focus around 26 retailers in more than 13 countries gives me a unique perspective on the retail environment in Australia. I have purposely kept the insights gained while personally working with some of these retailers away from this analysis. This better allows me to get an outside-in perspective of the industry while also respecting nondisclosure agreements.&nbsp;</span></p></div>

This probably reflects the less volatile nature of the Australian retail market without disruptors such as Amazon (as mentioned above).</li><li>Higher SG&amp;A percentage, as a portion of revenue, which most likely is the result of Australia’s higher wages. As the Australian inflation rate rises and the Fair Work Commission introduces a 2.6 percent increase in minimum wages, you can expect the SG&amp;A ratio to rise, industry-wide. To give you some context, at Tesco, Britain’s biggest retailer, the wage costs are about £4.5bn, which indicates that every 1 percent rise in wage costs increases the company’s expenses by about £45m, so a 2.6 percent increase could have significant impact on retailers’ operating/net margins.</li></ol><p><br></p><p>Now, let's move on to the individual retailer analyses.</p></div>

There are two key call outs for Myer based on the financial analysis:</p><p><br></p><ol><li>SG&amp;A costs are a significant portion of revenue at 60% . No other Australian retailer operates at such high ratio. David Jones, Kmart and Target bear the same costs for Australian labour, yet SG&amp;A remains much higher for Myer. This indicates some operational overhead, and this problem is likely to worsen once the Fair Work Commission’s increase takes effect;</li><li><span style="font-size: 1.07rem; line-height: 1.5;">The impact on gross margin. Myer’s annual report states that the hit taken on their gross margins is primarily a consequence of increased concessional sales (up 21 percent and now equating to 19 percent of total sales). That may well be the case, but it’s hard to ignore the drastic impact that SG&amp;A is having on gross margin.</span></li></ol></div>

        <div class="row">
            <div class="col-xs-12 col-md-5 lead mbr-editable-full"><p><em>Potential Solutions</em>: If Myer decreased their SG&amp;A spend and implemented strategies to increase the margin on concessions, they could raise their gross margins even while carrying a higher-than-average SG&amp;A. After having seen how John Lewis and Harrods manage their concessions through my brief stint at Oxford University (e.g., offering digital signage in-store &amp; concessions staff training as a service), I think there are definitely opportunities to increase Myer’s concessions margin. Especially since concessions seem to be more prevalent globally with beauty bars, store-in-store services for premier differentiating brands and financial services such as exchanges</p></div>
            <div class="col-xs-12 col-md-7 lead mbr-editable-full"><blockquote>Combatting likes of Amazon: While these two strategies should certainly help drive margins, they may not be enough to fight the potential entrance of disruptors. Myer’s tactic of bringing in wanted brands (TopShops, Topman, etc.), optimising space in store (e.g., John Lewis store-in-store), urbanisation of store locations (e.g., $40M related to Werribee store refurbishment) and technology innovations (such as eBay virtual reality store) are a good start, but weathering the disruption requires bolder investments into digital and store channels. I would personally like to see Myer thump up its digital strategy, disclose digital investments in its annual statements in addition to reporting online growth as a precursor to driving shareholder confidence. With a large influx of visiting Asian shoppers, Myer could look to expand into luxury retail and enhance tailored shopping experiences akin to likes of Harrods/Selfridges in London, Isetan in Tokyo, Shinsegae in Seoul, etc. to become the premier department store of Australia</blockquote></div>

Owned by Woolworths in South Africa, it operates across 40 stores. In comparison to Myer, David Jones’ shows 12 percent of their sales through concessions (Myer at 21 percent), with larger sales coming through private brands. David Jones’ approach is to bring in wanted brands, leveraging the Woolworths SA brands (before branching out on the much publicised food business). The two biggest issues facing David Jones are:</p><p><span style="font-size: 1.07rem; line-height: 1.5;"><br></span></p><ol><li><span style="font-size: 1.07rem; line-height: 1.5;">Their significant gross margin;</span><br></li><li>Their significant operating margin</li></ol><p><br></p><p>While each of these margins has been reduced from the prior year, they still exceed most in the industry, indicating they are less subject to burdened profitability ratios. However, I do not see these as sustainable and could reduce to put more cash back into the end consumer. Inspite of the high margins average growth of 8 percent revenue per store and higher per-store EBITDA, David Jones’ average revenue per store is 2 percent less than Myer.</p></div>

Days sales and inventory outstanding are other key operating levers that David Jones could address to increase cash flow of operations. I have excluded DPO as trade liabilities are purely a derivation as a percent of total sales and accrued lease that has more than doubled over two years, probably indicating higher lease expenses</p></div>
            <div class="col-xs-12 col-md-7 lead mbr-editable-full"><blockquote>Combatting likes of Amazon: While investing in broader categories, such as fresh food, expanding operations into New Zealand, capitalizing on real estate assets (through leaseback/sale of the market street operations) and smaller format stores (Borrangaroo) are good strategies, I do wonder whether David Jones is prepared to tackle the larger disruption effects. I would like to see broader investments in store transformation (especially making those windows shine at least during the peak holiday season) and digital technologies (I’ve yet to see that loyalty program take effect since announcements in 2015). This will ultimately help them generate higher store traffic, customer reach and personalised sales.</blockquote></div>

Having this information might help us better understand whether investments (significant at $128m) in new stores are working. Based on revenue stagnation, it would seem Target must focus on growing revenue using the right mix of merchandising and EDLP strategy differentiated from Kmart to maintain cash flow to drive transformation. Margins are more likely to be improved with reduction in impairment expenses (approx. $600m) but likely be impacted across FY17 as this restructuring continues throughout next year as Target looks to get rid of unprofitable sales (e.g., toys sales). Overall a difficult period for Target may lie ahead as the company continues its transformation. The transition to the new William Landing location and incremental technology refreshes (e.g., InComm partnerships on gift card redemption in POS) should help but Target is still a prime brand to fall if Amazon strikes with Apparel launch in Australia. At a tactical level Target, should optimize their operating margin by controlling cost of sales.</p></div>

With an already failed $1.2B loss from Masters, Woolworth seems to be looking to release capital from its sale of petrol business to BP. The much-needed capital will help strengthen its balance sheet. While larger asset optimization continues to occur, Woolworths at a macro level should focus on optimising overall CODB (namely distribution costs and labour costs associated with overtime expenses) and continue their investment with store transformation.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 1.07rem; line-height: 1.5;"><br></span></p><p><span style="font-size: 1.07rem; line-height: 1.5;">Online (and broadly digital) investment should be increased.

Though office supplies remain the core merchandising strategy and expansion into broader office suppliers such as furniture indicate a good mix, I wonder whether the vested strategy of deep assortment mix is the right model in an environment of marketplace dominator Amazon.

In addition, the business has much higher branch costs (mostly employees’ costs and rent) and administration costs, therefore SG&amp;A improvements are a definite possibility.

The tendency of our retailers to underinvest in digital/store offerings and the countries high SG&amp;A costs are the biggest potential problems facing the overall Australian retail market. While we are only a country of $25+M with relatively lower innovative experiences, without innovation we are open to disruption from international brands and independent operators.</p><p><br></p><p>Have some insight to add?
